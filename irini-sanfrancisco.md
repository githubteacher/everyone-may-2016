# San Francisco, CA
### What's up with the city by the bay?
Generally a cool place {in the climatic sense of this word}, if you like it warm, stop by around the Indian Summer, that's around September/October. Other wise you can enjoy an year round weather that won't fluctuate much, always between 45f and 65f.
