##Getting Around
It’s tough! Public transportation isn’t the greatest, so make a new buddy with Lyft (https://www.lyft.com/cities/los-angeles) or Uber (https://www.uber.com/cities/los-angeles/). Better yet, rent a car!

##General Tips
San Francisco spans 46 miles. New York spans 305. Los Angeles is a whopping 503 miles.
Don't expect to see eveything in your first trip. If you're staying less than a week, you will probably be able to see 4-6 places. 
If you're headed to an amusement park, get an early start.
